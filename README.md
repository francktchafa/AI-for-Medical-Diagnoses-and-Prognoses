# AI for Medical Diagnoses and Prognosis

Welcome to my repository showcasing a suite of deep learning projects aimed at improving medical diagnosis across imaging modalities and diseases. Each subproject addresses unique challenges in clinical AI—from data imbalance to interpretability—while emphasizing reproducibility, fairness, and real-world utility.

**List of projects:**
1. [Deep Learning for Chest XRay Diagnosis](https://github.com/francktchafa/AI-for-Medical-Diagnoses/tree/main/AI%20for%20Chest%20XRay%20Diagnosis): A multilabel classifier to predict the presence or absence 14 thoracic diseases.
2. [Deep Learning for Brain Tumor Segmentation](https://github.com/francktchafa/AI-for-Medical-Diagnoses-and-Prognoses/tree/main/AI%20for%20Brain%20Tumor%20Segmentation): 3D semantic segmentation for brain tumor detection.
3. [Machine Learning for Detecting Retinopathy](https://github.com/francktchafa/AI-for-Medical-Diagnoses-and-Prognoses/tree/main/Linear%20Model%20for%20Retinopathy%20in%20Diabetes%20Patients): A linear risk model for retinopathy in diabetes patients.
4. [Machine Learning for Mortality Risk on NHEFS Epidemiologic Study](https://github.com/francktchafa/AI-for-Medical-Diagnoses-and-Prognoses/tree/main/Tree%20Models%2010yr%20Mortality%20on%20NHEFS%20Epidemiologic%20Study): Tree-based risk models for estimating the 10-year risk of death using the NHANES I Epidemiologic Follow-up Study.
